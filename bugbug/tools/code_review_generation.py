        You will be provided with the COMMENT, the LINE NUMBERS the comment is referring to,

        THINKING PROCESS:

           in the DIFF that need modification.
        3. **Analyze the DIFF**: Review the current state of the code in the DIFF to understand
           what is currently implemented.
        4. **Determine Necessary Changes**: Based on the COMMENT, decide what needs to be added,
           modified, or removed in the code. Focus on addressing the feedback without introducing
           unnecessary changes.
        5. **Generate the FIX**: Output the exact lines you are adding or deleting, using + and -
           symbols to indicate modifications. For example, if a line is being modified, show it as
           being removed (-) and then the corrected line as being added (+). ONLY address the comment.
